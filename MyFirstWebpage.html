         <br>   <u>The project begins with data collection, involving gathering and crating   a large dataset of news articles labelled as either fake or real. </u><br>
         <b>Pre-processing steps, including tokenization, stop-word removal  and text normalization, are applied to the dataset to prepare the data for modelling. Feature extraction is performed using advanced NLP methods such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings to represent textual data numerically.</b><br>
